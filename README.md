Project Title: 
Dine in or out (Satisfy ..your cravings)

Project Description: 
Modern problems require modern solutions! So in great fashion we set to answer one of the world’s most asked question…. What will we have for dinner?

Satisfy is an application that is designed for users who are unsure of what they can cook with the ingredients available, by using satisfy, these users can type in available ingredients and receive a range of delicious ideas which they are able to use and save to use again. Further, Satisfy has the functionality of recommending nearby eating locations through the user inputting a specific suburb. Therefore, Satisfy is convenient for users to make a choice to either cook meals depending on easily accessible ingredients or through searching for close eateries to enjoy a nice meal out.
